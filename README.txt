# 3D Space Station Pathfinding

## Overview
This project implements a **3D pathfinding algorithm** to navigate a complex space station environment. The goal is to efficiently find the shortest or most optimal path between two points while considering obstacles, varying gravity, and potential hazards.

## Features
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Implements A* and Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for efficient path computation.
- **3D Navigation**: Handles movement in a three-dimensional space with obstacles and different terrain.
- **Optimization**: Heuristics to improve performance in large-scale environments.
- **Visualization**: Renders paths in a 3D grid for better understanding.
- **Customizable Environment**: Users can define their own space station layouts.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/3d-space-station-pathfinding.git
   cd 3d-space-station-pathfinding
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(if applicable, replace with appropriate dependencies for your project)*

## Usage
Run the main script to start pathfinding:
```sh
python main.py
```
Modify `config.json` to set custom environment parameters.
